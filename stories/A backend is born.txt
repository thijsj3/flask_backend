title: A backend is born
content: This site wouldn't be a challenging learning project without its own backend to add to the list of things I would like to experiment with. So I added one.
But it has to add some useful functionality as well of course. Before when adding one of the stories I directly adjusted a json file in which I hold a list of stories. This json file was called every time someone entered the side and would be dissected into stories, with their header and content. Now I wrote a simple script that allows me to add each story as an individual text file. The backend reads all the files, collects the right segments and presents it to the frontend. 
This isnâ€™t the most efficient method of course, but it allows me to experiment with challenges like handing over tasks to a backend, practicing with a different programming language and storing data elsewhere. 
The backend has been built using Python with the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework. It currently runs a single function converting the text files to stories, but it would allow me to expend on the functionalities of this website.
